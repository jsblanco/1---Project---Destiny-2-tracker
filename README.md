# Project- Destiny 2 profile checker



## Description
Destiny 2 profile checker is a simple webpage that uses the Bungie API to enable users to check their Destiny 2 profiles wherever they are.


## MVP
- Responsive webpage (mobile-first, tablet, laptop)
- Display user search results and user profiles in a user-friendly manner, ensuring the website is intuitive. Info obtained via the Bungie API, at www.bungie.com/Platform/.
- To have at least a landing-page, sign-up form, log-in form, a FAQs wildframe and a wildframe were the user profile info is displayed. 
- Sign up-form and log-in form must have some validation format (i.e. password must be longer than 6 characters).
- The user data should be stored in local storage.


## Backlog
- A way for users to see their whole profile from the initial results
- Login and signup forms
- Enable signed-up users to retain their account info without having to search for it again
- HTML creation for everything except for the initial landing page

## Data structure
-User data will be obtain from the sign up form and stored in local storage. 
-API search results will be shared between functions through callbacks, while key data, such as profile numbers, may be stored within variables.
-Sign-up form will be stored locally, and the log-in form will look for information in the local storage. If it finds matching data, it will enable users to log in.
